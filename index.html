          <h4><a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2555671">Bike-Share Systems: Accessibility and Availability.</a>
          <small>Ashish Kabra, Elena Belavina and Karan Girotra
          <br><i>Revision invited at Management Science
          <br>Finalist, MSOM Best Student Paper Competition 2015
          <br>Runner Up, POMS Best Student Paper Award in Sustainability 2015</i></small> </h4>
          <p class="text-muted">The cities of Paris, London, Chicago, and New York (among others) have recently launched large-scale bike-share systems to facilitate the use of bicycles for urban commuting. This paper estimates the relationship between aspects of bike-share system design and ridership. Specifically, we estimate the effects on ridership of station accessibility (how far the commuter must walk to reach a station) and of bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bike at the station). Our analysis is based on a structural demand model that considers the random-utility maximizing choices of spatially distributed commuters, and it is estimated using high-frequency system-use data from the bike-share system in Paris. The role of station accessibility is identified using cross-sectional variation in station location and high -frequency changes in commuter choice sets; bike-availability effects are identified using longitudinal variation. Because the scale of our data, (in particular the high-frequency changes in choice sets) render traditional numerical estimation techniques infeasible, we develop a novel transformation of our estimation problem: from the time domain to the “station stockout state” domain. We find that a 10% reduction in distance traveled to access bike-share stations (about 13 meters) can increase system-use by 6.7% and that a 10% increase in bike-availability can increase system-use by nearly 12%. Finally, we use our estimates to develop a calibrated counterfactual simulation demonstrating that the bike-share system in central Paris would have 29.41% more ridership if its station network design had incorporated our estimates of commuter preferences — with no additional spending on bikes or docking points.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2520529">Online Fresh Grocery Retail: A La Carte or Buffet?</a>
          <small>Elena Belavina, Karan Girotra and Ashish Kabra 
          <br> <i>Conditionally accepted at Management Science</i></small></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">This paper identifies the best revenue models for firms aspiring to capture the untapped trillion-dollar opportunity in online retail of fresh groceries. We compare the financial and environmental performance of two revenue models: the per-order model, where customers pay for each delivery; and subscription, where customers pay a subscription fee and receive free deliveries. We build a stylized model that incorporates customers with ongoing uncertain grocery needs who choose between shopping offline or online and an online retailer that makes deliveries through a proprietary distribution network. In contrast with practitioners’ widely-held views, we find that subscription incentivizes a customer order pattern that reduces total grocery sales on account of lower food waste. Subscription also has higher delivery costs, but these disadvantages are countered by delivery scale economies, lower grocery acquisition costs and potentially higher adoption of the online channel. From an environmental perspective, the per-order model has higher food waste related emissions, while subscription leads to higher travel. Ceteris paribus, the per-order model is both financially and environmentally preferable for retailers with higher margin and higher consumption product assortments, sold in sparsely populated markets spread over large elongated areas with high delivery costs. Based on geographic and demographic data, we find that for typical products subscription yields higher profits in small, dense, circular markets (Paris, Beijing) whereas per-order performs better in elongated or sparse and large markets (Manhattan, Los Angeles). Subscription is always environmentally superior because lower emissions from food waste dominate higher travel-related emissions.</p>

          <h4>The Efficacy of Incentives in Scaling Marketplaces
          <small>Ashish Kabra, Elena Belavina and Karan Girotra </small></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">Achieving scale is key to the efficacy, survival and eventual domination of peer- to-peer marketplaces. Marketplace operators often run aggressive promotions and incentive schemes to attract new users or increase the usage of existing users. This study quantifies and compares the effect of incentives given to the “buyer” side and “seller” side of the marketplace. Specifically, using data from one of the leading transportation marketplace, we estimate the effect of passenger incentives and driver incentives on number of rides arranged through the marketplace. We find that incentives given to drivers in this marketplace are more effective at increasing the number of rides taken compared to incentives given to passengers. This indicates that incentives are most effective when given to the more price sensitive side of the marketplace, while the other side is attracted to the platform due to increased service levels.</p>

          <h4>Demand Asymmetry and Design of Bike-Share Systems.
          <small>Ashish Kabra</small></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">Demand flow directions in a bike-sharing System is asymmetric. Cities differ on the amount of asymmetry in demand because of city structure and commuter flow patterns. In this study we derive a measure of demand asymmetry for a system. We then characterize the effect of this demand asymmetry on the decisions of number of bikes and number of docks as well as the frequency with which these bikes will have to be reallocated from full stations to empty ones. This analysis should help guide the design of new bike-sharing systems.</p>

          <h4>New Product Introductions: Improving Demand Information and Supply Responsiveness.
          <small>Aditya Jain, Ashish Kabra and Nils Rudi</small></h4>
          <p class="text-muted">This study addresses the challenge of matching demand and supply in the product introduction phase. We model the effects of prepositioning strategies designed to increase responsiveness and adopt a dynamic approach which permits linking to management of products that have reached steady state. Empirical calibration and evaluation of this strategy is made possible using data from a major cosmetics company marketing their own products in the Middle East and where the approach has been implemented.</p>
